Thank you for wanting to contribute to the project!

More modules and options are always welcome. However, they're expected to follow some style guides.

## RFC42 and impure options

Each option should aim to have an RFC42 variant and an impure path variant.

An RFC42 option is what you're familiar with from nixos or home-manager, where the attribute set is automatically
transformed into the correct language.

An impure path variant may be less familiar to you. All the wrappers in adios-wrappers aim to support an impure mode. If
the user runs toString on a config file they've provided (ex: `configFile = toString ./gitconfig;`), then the path won't
be copied to the nix store, and will instead be turned into a string which is read from at runtime. This means the user
can run their program and have it always use the newest version.

Any new configuration options should be added with both variants, with checks that the options aren't both set at once.
Here's an example module that adds both:

```nix
{ types, ... }:
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.path = "/nixpkgs";
    mkWrapper.path = "/mkWrapper";
  };

  options = {
    settings = {
      type = types.attrs;
      description = ''
        Settings to be injected into the wrapped package's `foo.toml`.

        See the documentation for valid options:
        https://fake.website.com

        Disjoint with the `configFile` option.
      '';
    };
    configFile = {
      type = types.pathLike;
      description = ''
        `foo.toml` file to be injected into the wrapped package.

        See the documentation for valid options:
        https://fake.website.com

        Disjoint with the `settings` option.
      '';
    };

    package = {
      type = types.derivation;
      description = "The foo package to be wrapped.";
      defaultFunc = { inputs }: inputs.nixpkgs.pkgs.foo;
    };
  };
  impl =
    { options, inputs }:
    let
      inherit (inputs.nixpkgs.pkgs) formats;
      generator = formats.toml {};
    in
    assert !(options ? settings && options ? configFile);
    inputs.mkWrapper {
      symlinks = {
        "$out/foo/foo.toml" =
          if options ? configFile then
            options.configFile
          else if options ? settings then
            generator.generate "$out/foo/foo.toml" options.settings
          else
            null;
      };
      environment = {
        FOO_CONFIG_FILE = "$out/foo/foo.toml";
      };
    };
}
```

## Description guidelines

All newly introduced options should come with descriptions. These descriptions should follow the established format
that's been used in the other modules. To ease this experience, a template is provided for the most common types of
option.

### `settings`

```nix
description = ''
  Settings to be injected into the wrapped package's `$FILE_NAME`.

  See the documentation for $DOCS_REASON:
  $DOCS_LINK_HERE

  Disjoint with the `configDir` option.
'';
```

The documentation section is optional if there's not a good link, but trying to find one would be nice.

### `configFile`

```nix
description = ''
  `$FILE_NAME` file to be injected into the wrapped package.

  See the documentation for $DOCS_REASON:
  $DOCS_LINK_HERE

  Disjoint with the `settings` option.
'';
```

### `flags`

```nix
description = ''
  Flags to be automatically appended when running $PROGRAM_NAME.

  See the documentation for $DOCS_REASON:
  $DOCS_LINK_HERE

  Disjoint with the `$DISJOINT_OPTION` option.
'';
```

### `package`

```nix
description = "The $program_name package to be wrapped.";
```
